                                On any given weekend, you can probably find me on a pitch somewhere in Brooklyn playing pickup soccer. To me, this sport is more than just a sport. It is a vehicle for reminding ourselves that while we may come from different cultures, we are all essentially the same.

                                I love to cook almost as much as I love to eat and entertain. Eating well and occasionally wowing your friends is great but recently I have become very interested in the American food system and in the long term I hope to work on projects that improve our societyâ€™s access to quality food from small scale producers.
