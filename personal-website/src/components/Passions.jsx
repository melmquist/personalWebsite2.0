                            On any given weekend, you can probably find me on a pitch somewhere in Brooklyn playing pickup soccer. To me, this sport is more than just a sport. It is a vehicle for reminding ourselves that while we may come from different cultures, we are all essentially the same.

                            I love to cook almost as much as I love to eat and entertain. Eating well and occasionally wowing my friends is great but recently I have become very interested in the American food system and in the long term I hope to work on projects that improve our societyâ€™s access to quality food from small scale producers.

                            I grew up in NYC and played in bands throughout my life...I still play but now I like to listen and appreciate more about different types of music because like all art, it tells you about the culture and subject matter of where it came from
